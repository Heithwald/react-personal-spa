# My personal portfolio/practice SPA

This one is quite barebones at the moment, but it will become something in a short while

## Quick start guide:

1. Download the repo and extract it 
2. Open it in a code editor of your choice (I am using VSCode), then open a new terminal and execute the command below. It will hook up the JSON-server to the app for all the HTTP-requests to work.

#### npm
```
json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 8000
```

#### yarn
```
yarn json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 8000
```

3. Start the app and test its functionality
